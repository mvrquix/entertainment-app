## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate between Home, Movies, TV Series, and Bookmarked Shows pages
- Add/Remove bookmarks from all movies and TV series
- Search for relevant shows on all pages
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application
- **Bonus**: If you're building a full-stack app, we provide authentication screen (sign-up/login) designs if you'd like to create an auth flow

## My process

### Built with

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction)
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

The next step to this project would be to create a server application to persist data with endpoints for the frontend to network with. With that in place
it would make sense to centralize state management on the frontend in a redux store.
